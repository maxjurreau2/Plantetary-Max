# Portal-OS — Rebuild 2

**Integrated Operating System Architecture**

> Rebuild 1 proved the system works.  
> Rebuild 2 makes the system whole.

Portal-OS is a distributed operating system built on Cloudflare Workers, with a kernel written in Python and a cognitive architecture built on SIM (Symbolic Intelligent Model).

## Rebuild 2 — What It Is

Rebuild 2 is the **integration rebuild** — the phase where Portal-OS transforms from a set of working components into a **unified, internally coherent operating system**.

### Purpose

Transform Rebuild 1's successful deploy state into a fully integrated Portal-OS architecture where every subsystem is wired together into a single deterministic runtime.

### Key Additions

1. **Worker → Kernel Bridge** — Message bridge between Worker entrypoint and Kernel boot
2. **Kernel Initialization Sequence** — Formalizes invariants, module loading, scheduler startup, governance + identity registration
3. **Multi-Domain Scheduler** — Cognitive, orchestration, substrate, and governance lanes
4. **SIM Cognitive Wiring** — Kernel → SIM integration (Core, State, Trajectory, Compute)
5. **TEC Execution Layer** — Pipelines, agents, surfaces, governance hooks
6. **Identity + Governance Enforcement** — Wired into routing, orchestration, kernel invariants
7. **Routing Table** — Deterministic routing from Worker → Kernel → SIM → TEC → Substrate → Worker
8. **Substrate State Model** — DO state, KV persistence, substrate invariants

## Rebuild 2 — Build Order

1. ✓ Worker → Kernel bridge
2. ✓ Kernel boot + invariants
3. ✓ Scheduler domain lanes
4. ⏳ SIM wiring
5. ⏳ TEC pipelines
6. ⏳ Identity + governance
7. ⏳ Routing table
8. ⏳ Substrate state model
9. ⏳ Full integration test

## System Invariants

Portal-OS maintains these invariants across all layers:

### Tier 1: Foundational
- **State Coherence** — System state must be consistent across all layers
- **No Silent Failures** — Every failure must be logged and escalated

### Tier 2: Security
- **Authorization Enforced** — Every operation must be authorized
- **Identity Established** — Every message must carry valid identity

### Tier 3: Messaging
- **Message Ordering** — Intra-domain ordering is strict
- **No Message Loss** — Every message is processed or explicitly rejected
- **Message Timeout** — Messages have bounded age

### Tier 4: Concurrency
- **Scheduler Cycles Complete** — Cycles complete within bounded time
- **No Deadlock** — Lanes never deadlock each other

### Tier 5: Substrate
- **Substrate Consistent** — DO + KV state synchronized
- **KV Eventual Consistency** — System handles eventual consistency gracefully

### Tier 6: Execution
- **SIM Trajectory Valid** — SIM state trajectory is always valid
- **TEC Execution Bounded** — TEC agents complete within bounded time

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Node.js 18+
- Cloudflare Workers account

### Running Kernel Boot
```bash
python kernel/boot.py
```

This will execute the full boot sequence:
1. Load invariants
2. Load modules
3. Start scheduler
4. Register governance
5. Register identity

### Next Steps
- Implement SIM cognitive wiring
- Wire TEC execution layer
- Connect routing table
- Implement identity + governance subsystems

## Development

### Testing Invariants
```bash
python -c "from kernel.invariants import InvariantChecker; InvariantChecker().check_all()"
```

### Scheduler Simulation
```bash
# TODO: Add scheduler test harness
```

## Status

- **Rebuild 2**: Active
- **Architecture**: Defined
